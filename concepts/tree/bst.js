/** Tree: Non linear data structure
 * Depth of a node x: length of path from root to node x
 * Height of a node in tree: no of edges in the longest path from x to leaf node.
 *
 * Node in a tree: has three fields - data, left, right
 * Strict binary tree: 0 or 2 children nodes
 * Complete binary tree - all nodes must have 2 except leaf nodes.
 * level === depth
 * max no of nodes at level i = 2 ^ i
 * Perfect Binary Tree: All levels will be completely filled.
 * 
 * Max no of nodes in a binary tree with height h 
 * 2 ^ (h+1) - 1
 * height of a perfect tree with the given number of nodes - h = log2(n) - 1
