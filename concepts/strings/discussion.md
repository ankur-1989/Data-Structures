# String

1. Strings in JavaScript are immutable
2. Strings in built operations mostly take O(n) time complexity
3. Two strings can be compare with equality operator. that means operator overloading is there in JavaScript?

Important points:

* We should not use string concatenation in loop as it leads to O(n^2) time complexity.
* In normal statements it takes O(n+m) time complexity.
* As an alternative, we can use either Array or template literals to concat strings.

Questions:

* Is String mutable or immutable in Python?
* How do you compare two strings in python?
