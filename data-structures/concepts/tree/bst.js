/** Tree: Non linear data structure
 * Depth of a node x: length of path from root to node x
 * Height of a node in tree: no of edges in the longest path from x to leaf node.
 *
 * Node in a tree: has three fields - data, left, right
 * Strict binary tree: 0 or 2 children nodes
 * Complete binary tree - all nodes must have 2 except leaf nodes.
 * level === depth
 * max no of nodes at level i = 2 ^ i
